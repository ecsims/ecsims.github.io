                    <h2>Mia Goth Does the Work</h2>
                    <p>Stepping onto a film set for the first time—and that film being Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac—might be overwhelming for the average actor. If you’re Mia Goth, it’s simply setting the tone for the decade to come. Having worked since then in more extravagantly stylized, chilling titles like Suspiria, High Life, A Cure for Wellness, and Infinity Pool, she’s become an indelible screen presence, ethereal and grounded all at once.</p>
                    <p>But it was Pearl, as Goth herself puts it, that changed everything. Directed by Ti West and cowritten by Goth, the thriller has earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her first true leading role, a treasure of camp and grit. Having started her career at 19, the London-born actress says, “For a while, it was always a miracle to me that I would get another job. It’s Pearl which changed me, in terms of how I view myself and my ability as a performer. That project was an opportunity for me to experience a performance-driven story for the first time—very little plot, just very character-focused.”</p>
                    <p>Goth and West first collaborated on X, a slick homage to the slasher films of the 1970s in which Goth played the dual role of the aspiring adult film star Maxine and the elderly, menacing Pearl. She calls X a showcase for West, “an opportunity for him to be a director and pay respect to the films he grew up with.” But the extent of Goth’s preparation to play Pearl convinced West to ask her to cowrite the prequel, focused entirely on that character as a young woman. A24 had yet to greenlight a follow-up, but the director, already gearing up production on X in New Zealand, took a chance and asked Goth to begin fleshing out Pearl’s origins.</p>

                    <p>“I would wake up very early, put my phone on a timer for maybe an hour at a time, and write in the style of a stream of consciousness, rather than script form, because I found that to be an obstacle in me getting my ideas down,” she says. “I would write as Pearl, as me…but Pearl is me. I mean, all my characters are me, turned up or turned down. It’s all me exploring different facets of myself.”</p>
                    <p>Set on a Texas homestead in 1918, Pearl meets a striving but already violence-prone version of the character, who sees her parents as obstacles between her and dreams of silent movie stardom. Goth constructed Pearl around two personal gold standards: Björk’s groundedness in Von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark, one of her all-time favorite performances, and Judy Garland’s wide-eyed innocence in The Wizard of Oz. But though the film is suffused with allusions to the golden age of Technicolor, she’s not necessarily drawn to those types of movies. “I really needed to ground it in truth, so that’s where my references come in: to balance the naive insanity of [the film’s] Technicolor with an honest, vulnerable portrayal of who Pearl is.”</p>
                    <p>She brings to Pearl an old-school showbiz ability to plant her feet firmly in a character’s headspace before swinging an emotion into the stratosphere. As Pearl’s descent into madness is amplified by Goth’s increasingly heightened performance, the film’s initial campiness—all sunshine and smiles on the family farm—inverts into a disturbing reality with serious consequences. “I didn’t play camp, but the world around me, with the colors, and the perfect sheep, and the perfect cow, all that could be perceived that way,” Goth says. “My job as an actor is to make it as honest as possible. That’s the thing: Whenever I’m in ‘genre’ movies, that’s never really something I’m thinking about. I’m just trying to understand and empathize with my character.”</p>

                    <p>About those scare quotes around genre: Goth is well aware of her reputation as a scream queen (“They do say that,” she winces). But she’s firm in her readings of these films as dramas, and insists that the reliance on the term horror is more a marketing tactic than anything else. In Pearl, she says, her character “is just coming to terms with where she’s at in her life, with horror really within her. I don’t think it’s a horror movie at all; I don’t think a lot of the movies I do are.” </p>
                    <p>Still, there’s an undeniable emphasis on style in the projects she selects, immediately evoked in the names of her directors: Guadagnino, Cronenberg, Denis, Von Trier. It’s them who she credits with her choice of scripts. “I’m very director-driven. If I don’t trust the person who’s the head of the ship, I really don’t think there’s any point in being involved in something. So I watch their movies, or am a fan to begin with, and get an understanding of the worlds that they’re in. I enjoy seeing what movies have inspired them, what references they’re looking to. I would pretty much do anything for my role, to be good.”</p>

                    <p>Goth plans to reunite with West for a third film in their Pearl universe, titled MaXXXine and centered on her younger character from X. It’s a choice she’s making carefully. “I’m not the kind of actor that’s going to do four or five movies a year, I don’t think that that’s a good way to work,” she says. “I think you need to go and live a whole life, and put things into the ‘pain well’ and into the ‘joy well’ and the ‘heartbreak well,’ so that you’re able to come to set and and just give yourself completely. I think you should feel like you’re run dry by the time you finish a movie. I don’t think you should feel as though you’re able to just jump onto another set, because then you’re just playing yourself.”</p>
                    <p>Despite the demure, almost whisper-quiet demeanor she presents, Goth charges the room with an air of intensity as she speaks of her craft. She savors her attraction to the “deep animal urges” characters like Gabi in Infinity Pool or Pearl display, explaining that she relies on her body, which has “far better ideas than my head,” once shooting begins. She lists Marion Cotillard and Cate Blanchett as inspirations, both on- and offscreen. Goth, who is not on any social media, says a one-time slight desire to get on Instagram was quashed when she learned Blanchett herself is not on the app.</p>
                    <p>Though she won’t be returning to the X trilogy as a writer, Goth says she feels energized by the experience, and that a role like Pearl would have daunted her even a few years back. “To be so involved with a project from its conception, and see an idea morph into what it then becomes was extraordinary, and really empowering in many ways,” she says. “I think roles come to you right at the time when you’re ready to receive them.” </p>
